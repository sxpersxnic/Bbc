## introduction

**For our backend we will use following packages:**

*(This is also how the dependencies in your package.json should look like for this project)*

- ## bcrypt

    This package is used for hashing passwords securely. It's commonly employed to store hashed passwords in databases to enhance security.

- ## bryptjs  

    A JavaScript implementation of bcrypt. It is often used in Node.js environments.

- ## body-parser  

    This middleware parses the incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under req.body. It's commonly used to parse JSON and URL-encoded data.

- ## cookie-session  

    This middleware provides cookie-based session management. It allows you to store session data on the client side within cookies.

- ## cors  

    CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. This package enables the server to handle cross-origin requests and define who can access the server's resources.

- ## dotenv  

    Loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env, making it easy to manage configuration settings.

- ## express  

    A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

- ## express-jwt  

    Middleware for handling JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication in Express applications.

- ## helmet

    A middleware that helps secure Express apps by setting various HTTP headers, adding a layer of protection against common web vulnerabilities.

- ## http-status-codes

    A library that provides a set of HTTP status codes for more readable code when dealing with HTTP responses.

- ## jotai

    A state management library for React applications.

- ## jsonwebtoken

    Used for creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT), which are often used for authentication and information exchange between parties.

- ## jwt-decode

    A library for decoding JWTs on the client side, useful for extracting information from the token.

- ## morgan

    HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js. It logs requests to the console, which can be helpful for debugging and monitoring.

- ## mysql2

    A MySQL driver for Node.js. It allows Node.js applications to connect to and interact with MySQL databases.

- ## nanoid

    A small, secure, and URL-friendly unique ID generator. Useful for generating unique identifiers.

- ## nodemon

    A development utility that monitors for changes in files and automatically restarts the server when changes are detected.

- ## uuid

    A library for generating universally unique identifiers (UUIDs).

- ## yup

    A schema validation library for JavaScript and TypeScript. It's often used for validating and sanitizing user input.

(These are the devDependencies -> We only need them in development and not in production)

- @types/bcryptjs
- @types/cors
- @types/dotenv
- @types/eslint
- @types/express
- @types/helmet
- @types/http-status-codes
- @types/nodemon

**These are TypeScript type definitions for the respective packages, providing TypeScript support and autocompletion.**

- ts-node-dev: A development tool for running TypeScript applications. It provides fast incremental compilation and automatic restarting.
- typescript: The TypeScript compiler. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. It is used to enhance code maintainability and catch potential errors during development.
